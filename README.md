## [ENG]
Hello, my name is Natalia, but on the internet, I go under `hilgardite`, `jasmine-and-irises` or `irises-and-jasmine`. 
I'm not a professional when it comes to coding; most what I do in here, on GitHub, is learning from the others and appreciating nice fonts uploaded by some users.
### Who am I? 
<small>(A question I ask myself nearly every hour)</small><br>
### My (quite boring) repositories
#### [1.] Twine rework
A place where I wish to put my old e-lit pieces (the ones I made for my uni class). Currently, they have cluttered messy codes, very long and redundant I believe. I'll try to make the codes neater, lighter, and rework some default styles/JS created by Twine that I couldn't change while creating aforementioned works. I plan to add not only the whole works, but also extract some of their parts that could exist separately, such as stylesheets. Maybe some of the files uploaded by me will be useful to those willing to explore some Twine customisation ideas :).
#### [2.] uni projects
Basically, the name should say everything. But my major is not IT-focused and there may seem to be no opportunities to use code or make documents suitable for uploading on GitHub. For now, the only thing I'm considering to add in here is a simple webpage for _information & communication technologies in teacher's work_. It was recommended to be built in Wix, but I don't wish to support this platform and the company managing it. As there are no completely free alternatives to Wix, by which I mean fully WYSIWYG web design visual editors allowing for wide customisation of the page, I decided to write the page myself from the scratch. 
### some projects I wish to create one day
- [ ] **a linear, fixed-width grotesque font**
- highly legible, with distinguised, slabbed capital "I" and lower-case "l" with a curved stroke
- visually similar glyphs: "b", "p", "d", "q" shaped differently (not based on one glyph, mirrored in _x_ or _y_ axis)
- slashed zero by default, as for not being confused with capital "O"
- wide range of languages supported
  - I use the Latin script myself, so first and foremost the glyphs will be designed for languages using this script.
    - I'd love to create glyphs for the IPA or Slavonic phonetic alphabet, too!
    - I also know Cyrillic script and the Greek one a bit, but honestly know nothing about principles of glyph design in them, the distinctive features of their specific glyphs and readability/legibility guidelines for these scripts.
    - There are less scripts I don't know than the ones I do, in facts, so first I'd have to learm a bit about them to be able to properly design their glyphs. <br><br>
- [ ] **simple and elegant, brutalist grotesque font for an e-lit tool logo**
  - maybe not the most legible one, as I thought it should be quite distinctive
  - inktraps welcome, I like them very much
  - some fancy features, such as custom ligatures, alternative styles (let's make use of what OpenType has to offer) <br><br>
- [ ] **tool for changing text with _Latin Extended_ glyphs into "social media fancy fonts"**
  - by "social media fancy fonts" I mean _Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols_. They are widely used on social platforms that not allow any text formatting as a plain text substitute for Markdown features.
  - there already are some tools transforming input text into its "fancy font" counterparts. However, I've not come across a one suitable for _Latin Extended_ yet.
  - _Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols_ represent only glyphs from _Basic Latin_. _Latin Extended_ characters have to be created by merging the MAS glyph with a proper _Combining Diacritical Symbol_ glyph.
